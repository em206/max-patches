# FSK sync via Ableton Link.

![Screenshot of the FSK sync patch in the middle of some mayhem](/fsk-sync/fsk-sync-screenshot-v1.16.png)

This patch generates an FSK sync tone, tested with a Roland R-8 mkII.

It can apply drastic rate scaling and mute sections of time while staying quite well-synced.

## Caution

The patch is preconfigured to use channel 3 of the DAC and it starts audio on load.

## Changelog

### v1.16 - initial checkin
